# BERT4InvoiceEntities

## Introduction
`BERT4InvoiceEntities` leverages a fine-tuned BERT model to extract critical information from invoices, focusing on people's names, start dates, and end dates. This solution aims to automate and enhance the accuracy of data extraction from invoices, facilitating smoother financial and administrative processes.

## Installation
Begin by cloning the repository and installing the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BERT4InvoiceEntities.git
cd BERT4InvoiceEntities
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure Python 3.6+ and pip are installed on your system.

## Usage

To extract entity information from an invoice, execute the following command:

```bash
python extract_entities.py --invoice_path="path/to/invoice.pdf"
```
Replace `"path/to/invoice.pdf"` with the actual file path of your invoice document.

## Model Training and Fine-tuning
If you wish to train or fine-tune the model with your dataset:

1. Prepare your dataset in the format specified in the `data_format.md` document.
2. Run the training script with the following command:

```bash
python train_model.py --data_path="path/to/your/dataset.csv"
```
Refer to `training_guide.md` for detailed instructions on training and fine-tuning parameters.

## Docker Support
For ease of deployment and environment management, `BERT4InvoiceEntities` can be run inside a Docker container. See `Dockerfile` for the container setup. To build and run the Docker container:

```bash
docker build -t bert4invoiceentities .
docker run -v $(pwd):/app bert4invoiceentities python extract_entities.py --invoice_path="path/to/invoice.pdf"
```
